The Indoor Plant Monitoring System (IPMS) is an innovative solution designed to facilitate optimal growth and health of indoor plants through continuous monitoring and automated management of environmental parameters. In this project, we aim to develop a comprehensive system that not only monitors temperature, humidity, and soil moisture content but also integrates the delivery of essential nutrients to the soil for enhanced plant nutrition. The IPMS utilizes a range of sensors to gather real-time data on environmental conditions within the plant's environment. These sensors include those for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, providing accurate and timely information to users. When the soil moisture levels drop below a predetermined threshold, indicating the need for watering, the system activates a pump to deliver water to the plants. Moreover, the IPMS incorporates a nutrient delivery mechanism into the watering process. NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) nutrients are dissolved in the water before being fed to the soil. This ensures that the plants receive essential nutrients necessary for healthy growth and development. Additionally, the system is connected to the cloud-based Blynk platform, enabling remote monitoring and control from anywhere with internet access. 

By combining automated monitoring, watering, and nutrient delivery, the IPMS offers users a convenient and effective solution for indoor plant care. This integrated approach not only simplifies the maintenance of indoor plants but also promotes healthier growth and improved yields.
